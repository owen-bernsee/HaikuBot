<p2>This bot tweets once daily a randomly generated haiku from its library of over 50,000 words. The poems are titled & 'authored' by generating a randomly selected key/value (song title / artist) pair from Billboard's Top 100 Charts from 1998. This bot also knows hundreds of popular Americana colloquialisms and slang words</p2>

<p3><br>Creating this Twitter bot gave me an opportunity to expand upon the skills I have learned in ITT-184. I experimented, and became comfortable with API's such as Tweepy; which the app is built on. I became more comfortable navigating directories, and using the command line to deploy my project inside a virtual enviroment that is programmed to send out at tweet daily at 09:20 UTC.<br>I also wrote a command line GUI that accepts user inputs to populate dictionaries that the bot will tweet from. The program documents the user's name and contributions, securely being assigned to a dictionary in another file, where I have set up the administrator portion of the application.

<p4><br>I hope to continue this project even after completing this task in order to further develop my artistic and programming interests.
